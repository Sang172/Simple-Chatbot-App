## Simple Chatbot with Langchain and GPT-3.5 Turbo

This is the code for [a very simple chatbot](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sang172/practice_QandA_chatbot) I created using Streamlit, Langchain, and OpenAI's API.

It's based on the GPT 3.5 Turbo model and is deployed on huggingface.

It has a maximum limit of 1,000 tokens for the output.
